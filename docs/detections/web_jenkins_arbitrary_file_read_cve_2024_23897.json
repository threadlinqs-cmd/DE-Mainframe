  "Description": "The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit Jenkins Arbitrary File Read CVE-2024-23897. It detects HTTP POST requests to Jenkins URLs containing \"*/cli?remoting=false*\" with a 200 status code. This activity is significant as it indicates potential unauthorized access to sensitive files on the Jenkins server, such as credentials and private keys. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to severe data breaches, unauthorized access, and further exploitation within the environment.",

  "Detection Name": "Jenkins Arbitrary File Read CVE-2024-23897",
  "Objective": "Detect attempts to exploit Jenkins Arbitrary File Read vulnerability CVE-2024-23897",
  "Severity/Priority": "high",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Verify if the target is a Jenkins server\n2. Review the POST requests to /cli endpoint\n3. Check for successful file reads (200 status code)\n4. Analyze what files may have been accessed\n5. If exploitation is confirmed, isolate the Jenkins server and apply patches",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "False positives should be limited as this detection is based on a specific URL path and HTTP status code. Adjust the search as necessary to fit the environment.",
