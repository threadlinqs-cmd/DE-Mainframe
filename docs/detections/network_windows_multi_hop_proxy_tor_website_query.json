  "Description": "The following analytic identifies DNS queries to known TOR proxy websites, such as \"*.torproject.org\" and \"www.theonionrouter.com\". It leverages Sysmon EventCode 22 to detect these queries by monitoring DNS query events from endpoints. This activity is significant because adversaries often use TOR proxies to disguise the source of their malicious traffic, making it harder to trace their actions. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate an attempt to obfuscate network traffic, potentially allowing attackers to exfiltrate data or communicate with command and control servers undetected.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\nTo successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting logs with the process name and sysmon eventcode = 22 dns query events from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.\n\nPotential Impact:\nHigh - TOR usage may indicate data exfiltration or C2 communication attempts.",

  "Detection Name": "Windows Multi hop Proxy TOR Website Query",
  "Objective": "Detect DNS queries to TOR-related domains that may indicate use of TOR proxies for traffic obfuscation.",
  "Severity/Priority": "medium",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Identify the process making the TOR-related DNS query.\n2. Determine if TOR usage is authorized for the user/system.\n3. Check for data exfiltration or C2 indicators.\n4. Block TOR if not authorized for the organization.",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "Known False Positives: third party application may use this proxies if allowed in production environment. Filter is needed.",
