  "Description": "Detects M365 Copilot users exhibiting suspicious application usage patterns including multi-location access, abnormally high activity volumes, or access to multiple Copilot applications that may indicate account compromise or automated abuse. The detection aggregates M365 Copilot Graph API events per user, calculating metrics like distinct cities/countries accessed, unique IP addresses, number of different Copilot apps used, and average events per day over the observation period. Users are flagged when they access Copilot from multiple cities (cities_count > 1), generate excessive daily activity (events_per_day > 100), or use more than two different Copilot applications (app_count > 2), which are anomalous patterns suggesting credential compromise or bot-driven abuse.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\n- M365 Copilot access logs are ingested via Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Office 365\n- Azure AD Sign-in logs are collected through Graph API\n- Normal users access Copilot from limited locations\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Account compromise with credential theft\n- Automated bot abuse of AI services\n- Unauthorized multi-location access indicating shared credentials",
  "origin": "custom",
  "Detection Name": "M365 Copilot Application Usage Pattern Anomalies",
  "Objective": "Detect and alert on users with anomalous M365 Copilot usage patterns including multi-location access, excessive activity, or multiple application usage that may indicate account compromise.",
  "Severity/Priority": "Low",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Review the geographic locations from which the user accessed Copilot\n2. Check if activity volume aligns with user's normal behavior\n3. Verify with user if they travel frequently or use VPNs\n4. Look for signs of credential compromise or session hijacking\n5. Consider forcing password reset if unauthorized access is confirmed",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "Blind Spots:\n- VPN usage masking true geographic location\n- Legitimate high-volume users not baselined\n- New applications not yet tracked\n\nFalse Positives:\n- Power users, executives with heavy AI workloads, employees traveling for business, users accessing multiple Copilot applications legitimately, or teams using shared corporate accounts across different office locations may trigger false positives.",
