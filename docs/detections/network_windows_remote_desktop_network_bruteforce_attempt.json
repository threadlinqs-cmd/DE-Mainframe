  "Description": "The following analytic identifies potential Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute force attacks by monitoring network traffic for RDP application activity. This query detects potential RDP brute force attacks by identifying source IPs that have made more than 10 connection attempts to the same RDP port on a host within a one-hour window. The results are presented in a table that includes the source and destination IPs, destination port, number of attempts, and the times of the first and last connection attempts, helping to prioritize IPs based on the intensity of activity.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\nYou must ensure that your network traffic data is populating the Network_Traffic data model. Adjust the count and duration thresholds as necessary to tune the sensitivity of your detection.\n\nPotential Impact:\nHigh - Successful RDP brute force could lead to unauthorized access and system compromise.",
  "origin": "custom",
  "Detection Name": "Windows Remote Desktop Network Bruteforce Attempt",
  "Objective": "Detect RDP brute force attacks by identifying excessive connection attempts to RDP ports within a short time window.",
  "Severity/Priority": "medium",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Investigate the source IP for malicious activity.\n2. Check if the target system was compromised.\n3. Review authentication logs for successful logins.\n4. Block the source IP if confirmed malicious.",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "Known False Positives: RDP gateways may have unusually high amounts of traffic from all other hosts' RDP applications in the network. Any legitimate RDP traffic using wrong/expired credentials will be also detected as a false positive.",
