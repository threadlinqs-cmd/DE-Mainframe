  "Description": "Detects particularly high latency from Zoom logs. Latency observed from threat actors performing Remote Employment Fraud (REF) is typically well above what's normal for the majority of employees.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\n- Zoom logs are being ingested using Splunk Connect for Zoom\n- Normal employee video latency is below 300ms\n- High latency may indicate remote location or proxy usage\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Remote Employment Fraud detection\n- Identification of suspicious remote access patterns\n- Network quality anomaly detection",
  "origin": "custom",
  "Detection Name": "Zoom High Video Latency",
  "Objective": "Detect and alert on users with unusually high video latency in Zoom calls that may indicate Remote Employment Fraud or suspicious remote access.",
  "Severity/Priority": "Medium",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Review the user's typical latency patterns over time\n2. Compare with other employees in similar locations\n3. Check for other indicators of Remote Employment Fraud\n4. Verify user's reported location matches expected work location\n5. Consider combining with other REF indicators for a complete picture",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "Blind Spots:\n- Users with legitimately slow internet connections\n- VPN usage affecting latency measurements\n- Network infrastructure issues\n\nFalse Positives:\n- While latency could simply indicate a slow network connection, when combined with other indicators, it can help build a more complete picture. Tune the threshold as needed for your environment baseline.",
