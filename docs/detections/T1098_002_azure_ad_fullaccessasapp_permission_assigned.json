  "Description": "The following analytic detects the assignment of the 'full_access_as_app' permission to an application within Office 365 Exchange Online. This is identified by the GUID 'dc890d15-9560-4a4c-9b7f-a736ec74ec40' and the ResourceAppId '00000002-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000'. The detection leverages the azure_monitor_aad data source, focusing on AuditLogs with the operation name 'Update application'. This activity is significant as it grants broad control over Office 365 operations, including full access to all mailboxes and the ability to send emails as any user. If malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access and data exfiltration.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\n- Azure AD AuditLogs are being ingested via EventHub\n- Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services is installed\n- Application permission changes are being logged\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Full access to all Exchange Online mailboxes\n- Ability to send email as any user\n- Mass data exfiltration potential",
  "origin": "custom",
  "Detection Name": "Azure AD FullAccessAsApp Permission Assigned",
  "Objective": "Detect and alert when the full_access_as_app permission is assigned to an application, which grants extensive access to Exchange Online.",
  "Severity/Priority": "High",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Identify who assigned the permission and to which application\n2. Verify if the permission assignment was authorized\n3. Review the application's purpose and legitimacy\n4. Check for any mailbox access or email sending activity by the application\n5. Consider removing the permission if unauthorized",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "Blind Spots:\n- Permission assignments made through methods not captured in audit logs\n- Permissions assigned through delegated admin relationships\n\nFalse Positives:\n- The full_access_as_app API permission may be assigned to legitimate applications. Filter as needed.",
