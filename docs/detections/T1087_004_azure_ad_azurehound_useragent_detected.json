  "Description": "This detection identifies the presence of the default AzureHound user-agent string within Microsoft Graph Activity logs and NonInteractive SignIn Logs. AzureHound is a tool used for gathering information about Azure Active Directory environments, often employed by security professionals for legitimate auditing purposes. However, it can also be leveraged by malicious actors to perform reconnaissance activities, mapping out the Azure AD infrastructure to identify potential vulnerabilities and targets for further exploitation. Detecting its usage can help in identifying unauthorized access attempts and preemptively mitigating potential security threats to your Azure environment.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\n- MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs and NonInteractiveUserSignInLogs are being ingested via EventHub\n- Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services is installed\n- User-agent strings are being captured in logs\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Reconnaissance activity mapping Azure AD infrastructure\n- Enumeration of users, groups, and roles\n- Identification of attack paths for privilege escalation",
  "origin": "custom",
  "Detection Name": "Azure AD AzureHound UserAgent Detected",
  "Objective": "Detect and alert on the use of AzureHound tool for Azure AD reconnaissance, which may indicate unauthorized enumeration activities.",
  "Severity/Priority": "High",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Identify the user account associated with the AzureHound activity\n2. Verify if the user has legitimate reasons for running security audits\n3. Check the source IP and geolocation for anomalies\n4. Review what data was accessed during the reconnaissance\n5. Determine if this is authorized security testing or malicious activity",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "Blind Spots:\n- Custom user-agent strings used by modified versions of AzureHound\n- Other reconnaissance tools with different user-agent signatures\n\nFalse Positives:\n- None known. AzureHound usage should be verified with security teams.",
