  "Description": "Detects rare audio devices from Zoom logs. Actors performing Remote Employment Fraud (REF) typically use unusual device information compared to a majority of employees. Detecting this activity requires careful analysis, regular review, and a thorough understanding of the audio and video devices commonly used within your environment.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\n- Zoom logs are being ingested using Splunk Connect for Zoom\n- Most employees use standard corporate-issued or common consumer devices\n- Rare devices may indicate unauthorized remote access or fraud\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Remote Employment Fraud detection\n- Identification of unauthorized device usage\n- Anomalous equipment pattern detection",
  "origin": "custom",
  "Detection Name": "Zoom Rare Audio Devices",
  "Objective": "Identify rare audio devices in Zoom logs that may indicate Remote Employment Fraud or unauthorized device usage.",
  "Severity/Priority": "Low",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Review the specific rare device identified\n2. Compare against baseline of common devices in your environment\n3. Check if device is associated with a known employee\n4. Look for other Remote Employment Fraud indicators\n5. Build a complete picture with other anomaly detections",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "Blind Spots:\n- New devices not yet baselined\n- Legitimate rare devices for specialized roles\n- Device name spoofing\n\nFalse Positives:\n- This is a hunting query meant to identify rare audio devices.",
