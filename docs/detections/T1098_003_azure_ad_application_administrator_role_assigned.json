  "Description": "The following analytic identifies the assignment of the Application Administrator role to an Azure AD user. It leverages Azure Active Directory events, specifically monitoring the \"Add member to role\" operation. This activity is significant because users in this role can manage all aspects of enterprise applications, including credentials, which can be used to impersonate application identities. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could escalate privileges, manage application settings, and potentially access sensitive resources by impersonating application identities, posing a significant security risk to the Azure AD tenant.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\n- Azure AD audit logs are being ingested via EventHub\n- Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services is installed\n- Role assignments are being logged\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Privilege escalation to Application Administrator role\n- Ability to manage application credentials\n- Potential impersonation of application identities",
  "origin": "custom",
  "Detection Name": "Azure AD Application Administrator Role Assigned",
  "Objective": "Detect and alert when the Application Administrator role is assigned to a user, which grants significant privileges over enterprise applications.",
  "Severity/Priority": "Medium",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Identify who initiated the role assignment (initiatedBy)\n2. Verify if the role assignment was authorized\n3. Review the user receiving the role for legitimacy\n4. Check for any subsequent suspicious activity by the new Application Administrator\n5. Review application changes made after the role assignment",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "Blind Spots:\n- Role assignments made through methods not captured in audit logs\n- Nested group memberships that inherit the role\n\nFalse Positives:\n- Administrators may legitimately assign the Application Administrator role to a user. Filter as needed.",
