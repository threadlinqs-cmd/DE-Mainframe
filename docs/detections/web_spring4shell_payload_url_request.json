  "Description": "The following analytic detects attempts to exploit the Spring4Shell vulnerability (CVE-2022-22963) by identifying specific URL patterns associated with web shell payloads. It leverages web traffic data, focusing on HTTP GET requests with URLs containing indicators like \"tomcatwar.jsp,\" \"poc.jsp,\" and \"shell.jsp.\" This activity is significant as it suggests an attacker is trying to deploy a web shell, which can lead to remote code execution. If confirmed malicious, this could allow the attacker to gain persistent access, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially escalate privileges within the compromised environment.",

  "Detection Name": "Spring4Shell Payload URL Request",
  "Objective": "Detect attempts to exploit Spring4Shell vulnerability CVE-2022-22965 through web shell payloads",
  "Severity/Priority": "medium",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Review the source IP and destination to determine legitimacy\n2. Check if the target system is running Spring Framework\n3. Analyze the URL patterns for web shell indicators\n4. Correlate with endpoint telemetry for process execution anomalies\n5. If exploitation is confirmed, isolate the affected system and investigate for persistence",
