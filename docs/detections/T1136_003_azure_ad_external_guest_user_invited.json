  "Description": "The following analytic detects the invitation of an external guest user within Azure AD. It leverages Azure AD AuditLogs to identify events where an external user is invited, using fields such as operationName and initiatedBy. Monitoring these invitations is crucial as they can lead to unauthorized access if abused. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to gain access to internal resources, potentially leading to data breaches or further exploitation of the environment.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\n- Azure AD AuditLogs are being ingested via EventHub\n- Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services is installed\n- External guest invitations are being logged\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Unauthorized external access to internal resources\n- Data exfiltration through guest accounts\n- Persistence through external identities",
  "origin": "custom",
  "Detection Name": "Azure AD External Guest User Invited",
  "Objective": "Detect and alert on external guest user invitations which may indicate unauthorized access being granted to external parties.",
  "Severity/Priority": "Medium",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Identify who initiated the guest invitation (initiatedBy)\n2. Verify if the invitation was authorized and documented\n3. Review the external user's email domain for legitimacy\n4. Check if the guest user has accessed any resources\n5. Monitor for suspicious activity from the guest account",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "Blind Spots:\n- Guest invitations made through methods not captured in audit logs\n- B2B collaboration invitations through partner organizations\n\nFalse Positives:\n- Administrator may legitimately invite external guest users. Filter as needed.",
