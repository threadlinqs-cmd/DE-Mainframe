  "Description": "The following analytic detects the execution of 7z or 7za processes with command lines pointing to SMB network shares. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to archive and exfiltrate sensitive files to a network share, a technique observed in CONTI LEAK tools. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to data exfiltration, compromising sensitive information and potentially aiding further attacks.",
  "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\n- The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents\n- Target processes (7z.exe, 7za.exe, 7zr.exe) are being monitored\n- EDR data is properly configured and ingesting into Splunk\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Data exfiltration via network shares\n- Sensitive file archiving for unauthorized transfer\n- Ransomware staging activities",
  "origin": "custom",
  "Detection Name": "7zip CommandLine To SMB Share Path",
  "Objective": "Detect and alert on 7zip execution with command lines pointing to SMB network shares, which may indicate data exfiltration or staging for ransomware attacks.",
  "Severity/Priority": "Medium",
  "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Identify the user and endpoint executing the 7zip command\n2. Review the full command line to understand what files are being archived\n3. Check the destination SMB share path for legitimacy\n4. Review recent file access patterns on the endpoint\n5. Investigate if this is part of a larger data exfiltration campaign",
  "Blind_Spots_False_Positives": "Blind Spots:\n- 7zip executions using renamed binaries\n- Archive operations using other compression tools\n- Cloud-based file transfers not using SMB\n\nFalse Positives:\n- Legitimate backup operations using 7zip to network shares\n- IT administration activities\n- Authorized data migration tasks",
