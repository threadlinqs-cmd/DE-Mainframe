    "Description": "The following analytic detects high-risk sign-in attempts against Azure Active Directory, identified by Azure Identity Protection. It leverages the RiskyUsers and UserRiskEvents log categories from Azure AD events ingested via EventHub. This activity is significant as it indicates potentially compromised accounts, flagged by heuristics and machine learning. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources, leading to data breaches or further exploitation within the environment.",
    "Assumptions": "Assumptions:\n- Azure AD Identity Protection is enabled and configured\n- RiskyUsers and UserRiskEvents logs are being ingested via EventHub\n- Splunk Add-on for Microsoft Cloud Services is installed\n\nPotential Impact:\n- Compromised user accounts leading to unauthorized access\n- Data breaches and exfiltration of sensitive information\n- Lateral movement within the Azure AD environment",

    "Analyst Next Steps": "1. Review the specific risk events for the flagged user in Azure Identity Protection\n2. Check for any concurrent suspicious activities from the same user\n3. Verify if the source IP is associated with known malicious activity\n4. Contact the user to verify the sign-in attempt\n5. Consider resetting credentials if malicious activity is confirmed",
